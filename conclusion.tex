\section{Conclusion}
We proposed and developed ProTuner: a framework that uses an MCTS-based algorithm to automatically tune programs for high-performance deep learning and image processing applications. Our results demonstrated up to $3.25\times$ better performance compared to the state-of-the-art beam-search algorithm. Looking forward, we foresee a potential opportunity to continue scaling performance---despite the end of Moore's Law---through automatic program tuning and optimization, with machine learning algorithms such as MCTS.
